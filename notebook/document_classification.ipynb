       "'at the start of a big week for the higgs boson the most soughtafter particle in all of physics scientists in illinois said monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion. the scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than years of research and trillion particle collisions using the us department of energys fermilab tevatron collider near batavia illinois whose budgetary woes shut it down last year. what is the higgs boson and why is it important. their announcement came two days before researchers at the large hadron collider under the alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the cern particle physics laboratory in geneva switzerland. our data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson rob roser a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the tevatron said in a statement but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a discovery. read more the woman at the edge of physics. finding the higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass one of the open questions in physicists current understanding of the way the universe works. the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist leon lederman reportedly wanted to call his book the goddamn particle but he truncated that epithet to the god particle which may have helped elevate the particles allure in popular culture. more science news from cnn light years. the results from the tevatron stemming from the two different experiments suggest that if the higgs boson does exist it would have a mass between and gev about times the mass of the proton. before the tevatron closed the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a fourmile circumference in opposite directions traveling at a fraction below the speed of light the particles would crash into each other creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe. but so far neither the results from the us collider experiments nor from the the large hadron collider located feet underneath the border of france and switzerland have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery. it is easier to look for a friends face in a sports stadium filled with people than to search for a higgslike event among trillions of collisions said luciano ristori a physicist at the us facility. attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the billion european machine the worlds most powerful particle smasher. we now have more than double the data we had last year sergio bertolucci the director for research and computing at cern said last month that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the data are still there or whether theyve gone away its a very exciting time. scientists getting clearer picture of god particle.

mega pixels image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos. wolf brian cooley of cnetcom thank you so much. cooley you bet. end video clip. shoutout. george ramsay cnn student news time for the shoutout when did the first ipod debut if you think you know it shout it out was it a b c or d youve got three seconds go if you guessed c youve got the right tune the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of thats your answer and thats your shoutout. tech in the classroom. azuz whether its an ipod sony samsung or zune it seems like you cant go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of player and if youre on a college campus you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music but dont be fooled they could just be studying up for class. begin video clip. azuz walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere but sometimes the playlist isnt quite what youd expect lectures on computer science instead of american idol not so much sum as history. some teachers have used the audio ipod in their lessons but at the georgia institute of technology professor jim foley hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video ipod. professor foley user interface design teacher the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about better we did that three years ago. azuz as players become essential parts of students lives they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom with a graduate students help foley records lectures before class so that students can raise questions when they arrive students from foleys user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient. kathy pham student in professor foleys user interface design class it takes minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus and to be able just to download the to my ipod and just walk across campus would be very beneficial. scott gilliland student in professor foleys user interface design class a lot of people cant get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures and its nice to be able to take them with you. azuz although students show enthusiasm towards players there are limitations because theyre small. foley the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse with the ipod i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around. azuz like the laptop the player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information regardless of what teachers decide to use players and laptops will remain allies besides you need a laptop to operate an ipod and vice versa. end video clip. podcast promo. azuz and if downloading lectures isnt enough weve got another cool thing you can do with an player watch cnn student news thats right you can download our podcast at cnnstudentnewscom or at itunes so you wont miss out on the news when youre on the go. now and then. ramsay with cell phones thin is in but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor an ipod can hold your whole music library but a vintage walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time microchips keep getting smaller and smaller but old school computers took up a lot more space and game controllers have buttons for every possible move but the retro version one button one joystick tons of fun. learning with technology. azuz its not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech. begin video clip. trina davis president international society for technology in education we started off when we were first starting to integrate technology kind of at that basic level. matthew lewis junior greenside high school we of course use laptops and computers each teacher is assigned a laptop and also we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside. don knezek ceo international society for technology in education certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment doesnt necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning. ammarah mahmoud junior salem high school i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology so its important to learn that in school. knezek so you cant convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment. mahmoud i dont think schooling should be technology dependent because i think that at the same time we shouldnt rely on something that doesnt have a mind of its own. knezek you can certainly abuse technology you can abuse the printed word you can abuse access to external resources certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies then were in fine shape. lewis i can see people in the future having something where you just scan and all of your you know personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen and i think thats really cool. davis customization very innovative lots of gaming lots of spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners. end video clip. goodbye. azuz and that is the last word in this special edition of cnn student news well see you back here soon for our next summer show and of course we thank you for watching everyone im carl azuz email to a friend. \n",

      " - myrtle beach south carolina cnn discussions about proposals on the economy and health care were overshadowed by heated exchanges between rivals hillary clinton and barack obama during monday nights democratic debate. sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama started arguing almost as soon as the debate began. the two democratic frontrunners took shots at each others economic plans and criticized the accuracy of recent accusations the two campaigns have traded. obama said clintons charge that fiscal responsibility isnt a priority for him isnt true. this is one of the things that has happened in the course of this campaign there are a set of assertions made by sen clinton as well as her husband that are not factually accurate obama said raising the criticisms the clintons made about him in recent days. part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody who is going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that weve seen in washington he said. clinton replied she was referring to differences in obamas position toward the iraq war it was more about the distinction between words and action and i think that is a fair assessment for voters to make she said watch clinton obama trade jabs. clinton said it is sometimes difficult to understand what sen obama has said because as soon as he is confronted on it he says thats not what he meant. former north carolina sen john edwards jumped in saying are there three people in this debate not two. this kind of squabbling how many children is this going to get health care how many people are going to get education because of this how many kids are going to get to go to college because of this edwards said to cheers from the crowd. i respect both of my fellow candidates but we have got to understand this is not about us personally. cnn ireporters providing their reaction to the debate responded negatively to the bickering tone between clinton and obama. i am proud that sen edwards is taking the high road and making himself stand out from the bickering senators clinton and obama we dont need blame for our troubles we need solutions wrote david parker of san jose california. the two leading candidates are getting closer to nothing they will lose the election to republican party if they keep talking in such a way duop chak of colorado springs colorado wrote on cnncoms political ticker. the candidates are facing off in myrtle beach south carolina five days before the states democratic primary the debate was put together by cnn and the congressional black caucus institute see what the candidates said on the issues. cnn political analyst bill schneider said this could be a debate where john edwards gets back in the game. hes effectively making his points while barack obama and hillary clinton are in silly squabbles voters have too many concerns to care about obama and clintons political potshots schneider saidedwards said ending poverty is the cause of my life see what cnns political team thought about the attacks. now fiscal responsibility which i think was the question it was a little hard to tell there at the end of that but i think the question was about fiscal responsibility he said. i have proposed i think the most aggressive most progressive agenda of the three of us up here he said. on the issue of iraq clinton was asked if she is looking to end the war or win it. im looking to bring our troops home starting within days of my becoming president she said there is no military solution and our young men and women should not remain as the referees of their conflict. edwards said within his first year as president he would have all combat troops out of iraq and there would be no permanent military bases in iraq. i have not heard either of them say that definitively he said. obama responded saying i want to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in but i want to make sure that we get all of our combat troops out as quickly as we can safely watch edwards obama debate iraq. cnns wolf blitzer is moderating and cnns suzanne malveaux and joe johns are asking questions watch the crew get ready for mondays debate. clinton and obama directed some of their responses at each other instead of the panel of moderators. it is very difficult having a standup debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote clinton said after attacking obama for not supporting a senate amendment that would have capped the interest rate on credit cards at percent. its just very difficult to get a straight answer the comment drew boos from obama supporters. at one point clinton said that obama had represented a slum landlord business in chicago when he was practicing law which brought some boos from the audience. when given an opportunity to respond obama explained the law firm he used to work for represented a church group that had partnered with an individual to do a project and i did about five hours worth of work on this joint project thats what shes referring to. then he turned the explanation into a shot at clinton now its fine for her to throw that out but the larger reason that i think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say he said truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference. edwards said its being coming increasingly likely that the gop presidential nominee will be sen john mccain of arizona watch what mccain says about edwards. heres what we have to be thinking about who will be tough enough and strong enough and who can compete against john mccain in every place in america edwards said i think i can go everywhere and compete headtohead with mccain. so far in the democratic contests clinton a senator from new york has won new hampshire nevada and michigan in michigan she was the only major candidate on the ballot obama a senator from illinois won in iowa. edwards finished second in iowa but he has yet to win any states. edwards would like to rebound in south carolina his native state he won the primary there in when he was making his first bid for the white house. each of the candidates is trying to gain the support of the states africanamericans who make up almost half of the democratic primary voters. the majority of south carolina black democrats are leaning toward obama according to a cnnopinion research corp poll released friday. the poll suggests nearly percent of black registered democrats were backing obama as the presidential nominee with percent supporting clinton. thats a major shift from october when africanamericans backed clinton over obama percent to percent email to a friend. cnns wolf blitzer and bill schneider contributed to this report. \n",

      " - cnnlouisiana gov bobby jindal on monday stood by his criticism of socalled nogo zones in europe where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to muslim immigrants a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown. and the potential republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants insistence on nonassimilation the fact that youve got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values which he called dangerous. jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among republicans and boldly told gop officials during a address to the republican national committee that they must stop being the stupid party and needed to stop insulting the intelligence of voters. asked by cnns wolf blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on nogo zones made in a speech to the henry jackson society in london earlier that day jindal said not at all. msnbc guest wont apologize for jindal remark. and im also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical islam is a grave threat we need muslim leaders to denounce the individuals not just the acts of violence he said adding that it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation of immigrants in the united states. but pressed for specific examples of such nogo zones jindal demurred saying he had met with elected officials and others to discuss them and noted a report in uk tabloid the daily mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas. i knew by speaking the truth we were gonna make people upset jindal told blitzer. jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with cnns max foster saying that hes heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women dont feel comfortable going in without veils we all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into. i think that the radical left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here pretending its not here wont make it go away he told foster. pressed for details jindal said only i think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go. and asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates rather than the muslim population in the area jindal said this isnt a question. i know the left wants to make this into an attack on religion and thats not what this is what we are saying its absolutely an issue for the uk absolutely is an issue for america and other european and western nations he said. during his london speech jindal said in the west nonassimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home according to prepared remarks. it is startling to think that any country would allow even unofficially for a socalled nogo zone the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom he said. jindal also suggested the rise of such nogo zones has contributed to growing antisemitism throughout europe which has prompted many jews to emigrate from their home countries. how does such evil rise again in democratic countries jindal asked i believe it is because radical islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation he said. muslim leaders need to condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of islam he added. the idea of nogo zones sparked controversy last week when a fox news commentator raised the prospect of areas in france britain sweden and germany where those countries governments dont exercise any sovereignty and which instead are run largely by muslim immigrants. the commentator also mentioned whole cities where nonmuslims simply dont go in in particular the city of birmingham in the united kingdom. british prime minister david cameron later pushed back on the idea calling the commentator a complete idiot. when i heard this frankly i choked on my porridge and i thought it must be april fools day this guy is clearly a complete idiot he said. the fox commentator later apologized to birmingham for labeling it a nogo zone but stood by the idea that such areas exist fox news however issued a formal apology for the remarks with host julie banderas retracting the comments as regrettable errors and saying the network deeply regrets the errors and apologizes to any and all who may have taken offense. cnnmoney fox news apologizes times for inaccurate comments about muslims in europe. but a jindal aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared which included the criticism of the zones and the remarks have drawn praise from conservatives and attacted national media attention at a time when the potential presidential contender is looking to raise his profile in time for a white house bid. national review columnist larry kudlow called it a brilliant take on radical islam. it is the toughest speech i have read on the whole issue of islamic radicalism and its destructive murdering barbarous ways which are upsetting the entire world kudlow wrote in an oped. democrats though knocked jindal. its no surprise that bobby jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people this is exactly what weve come to expect from jindal here at home democratic national committee spokeswoman rebecca

      " - the norse god of thunder makes his bigscreen debut in the latest marvel movie the first of three heading our way this summer portents are good for future developments but director kenneth branagh makes heavy weather of the back story. if youre not up on your viking mythology thor is the guy with the hammer and the tempestuous temper in stan lees resurrection his father odin punished thors recklessness by condemning him to a double life as dr donald blake a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind. the movie gives us a brand new deity who is also a bit of both. the story teetertotters between the exiled thor crashlanding in new mexico where hes immediately run over by natalie portmans stormchasing astrophysicist jane and asgard where he vies with halfbrother loki tom hiddleston to vanquish the ice giants not a hockey team and win the respect of their father anthony hopkins gamely trying to inject some learlike gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets. an unholy combination of a vegas penthouse and disney palazzo asgard is a computergenerated valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing hubblesque views of the cosmos a vast waterfall drains out into space and an electric highway allows the gods to drop in on any of the nine realms one of which is earth the stereoscopic scenery is impressive but the screenwriters have a tin ear for godspeak settling for something between shakespeare and the mighty morphin power rangers. presumably this is why marvel turned the reins over to ken branagh whose credentials include hamlet henry v and much ado about nothing branagh has a penchant for backslapping bluster and bravado as well as the kind of kinky cameraangles that make you wonder if someones tripod has lost a leg which pretty well describes the movies exhaustingly lopsided first act. thor is on much safer ground here on earth the tone is immediately different more relaxed comic not cosmic as jane and her colleagues a wisecracking kat dennings and mistrustful stellan skarsgard figure out whether the blond muscle man who fell to earth is a lunatic or a miracle. in this incarnation thor has lost his power tool the hammer affectionately known as mjolnir but he has kept his wits about him and takes his new circumstances in his stride. ireport natalie portman should give her oscar back. beefy australian newcomer chris hemsworth seems to be channeling the young branagh in his portrait of an impetuous gallant alpha male burning to be king theres no finesse in the performance but broad strokes are all it takes the other actors just bounce off him and the movie finds its sense of fun. but it never settles for long all the substantial plotting takes place on the astral plane in asgard the new mexico episodes feel like a sideshow. ireport fans rave for thor. in essence another plank in the elaborate foundation work for the forthcoming avengers movie what thor sorely lacks is a center of gravity on the other hand it is as spectacular as million can buy and very much at the milder end of the spectrum it should hook legions of kids who can look forward to years more thor probably bigger and better in the future. \n",

      " - president barack obama signed legislation friday temporarily restoring full funding to the federal aviation administration breaking a political impasse and allowing roughly furloughed federal employees to return to work. the measure also promises to restore tens of thousands of jobs in the construction industry and elsewhere tied to airport improvement projects put on hold as a result of the funding shortfall. the bill took less than one minute to pass a nearly empty senate chamber friday morning it was cleared with a legislative maneuver known as unanimous consent which allows as few as two senators to approve a bill so long as no objections are filed most members of congress are currently away from washington on their summer recess. the president hailed the agreement noting that it removed the uncertainty hanging over the jobs of thousands of hardworking faa employees. this impasse was an unnecessary strain on local economies across the country at a time when we cant allow politics to get in the way of our economic recovery obama said friday im glad that this stalemate has finally been resolved. the political differences that led to the funding shortfall however have not been resolved democrats and republicans are still at sharp odds over whether to continue providing subsidies to smaller rural airports the two parties also differ over whether to make it easier for airline employees to unionize. congress will have to revisit the issue within six weeks to avoid another lapse in funding. outrage over congresss decision to adjourn for the summer without providing adequate funding for the approximately employees contributed to the push for at least a shortterm resolution transportation secretary ray lahood repeatedly took to the airwaves over the past several days cajoling lawmakers to come back from their break and reach an agreement. for workers facing the possibility of lost wages for weeks to come news of the breakthrough evoked an emotional response evelyn martinez an faa inspector cried when she learned of the deal. the tears are out of relief martinez said adding that while her postgraduate education taught her how government works what we are experiencing is outside of any textbook. this is a tremendous victory for american workers everywhere lahood said in a statement thursday from construction workers to our faa employees they will have the security of knowing they are going to go back to work and get a paycheck and thats what weve been fighting for. since authorization for faa funding expired in late july the agency has also been unable to collect federal taxes on airline tickets leading to a revenue loss of approximately million a day if the dispute had continued until congress returned in september the federal government would have lost over billion in revenue. senate majority leader harry reid dnevada had been in talks this week with house speaker john boehner rohio and administration officials about how to resolve the funding impasse a senate democratic leadership aide told cnn. reid noted thursday that the agreement does not resolve the important differences that still remain. but i believe we should keep americans working while congress settles its differences and this agreement will do exactly that he said. the agreement is the shortterm funding extension for the faa the republicanled house previously passed a shortterm extension but it included a number of changes opposed in the democraticcontrolled senate. one of the changes involves language in the house bill that would reduce or kill subsidies to rural airports specifically targeting some in nevada montana and new mexico three states with influential democratic senators. the senate ultimately agreed to pass the house bill but as part of thursdays agreement lahood will notify congressional leaders that he has the authority to grant waivers to affected community airports which would exempt them from the subsidy cuts. while no specific exemptions are required lahoods authority gives democrats the assurance that the disputed language they opposed can be overridden the leadership aide noted. a larger dispute regarding the unionization of airline workers has not been addressed at all however. republicans are livid over a recent ruling by the national mediation board that makes passage of a vote to unionize dependent only on getting more than support from those actually voting for example if a company has workers but only take part in the vote to unionize the rule change would mean only yes votes were needed for it to pass. under old rules more than of all workers eligible to vote or in this example yes votes would have been required for it to pass workers who didnt cast ballots were counted as having voted no making it more difficult for supporters to succeed. it remains unclear what if anything the divided congress will ultimately do in response to the change. cnns kate bolduan

      " - the first of twin research spacecraft entered the moons orbit saturday part of an effort to learn more about how it and other terrestrial bodies formed nasa said. the graila which launched from floridas cape canaveral on september along with its sister spacecraft grailb began a lunar orbit insertion burn at about pm et nasa said on an associated twitter feed. that burn was set to finish around pm the second in the pair grailb will follow suit sunday. burn complete graila is now orbiting the moon and awaiting the arrival of its twin grailb on new years day nasas jet propulsion laboratory announced on twitter. the two orbiters each feet high and feet deep are named for nasas gravity recovery and interior laboratory. they will fly in tandem orbits measuring the gravity field and ideally answering longstanding questions about the moon and giving scientists a better understanding of how earth and other rocky planets in the solar system formed according to nasa. the moon is about miles from earth a distance that nasas apollo crews reached in about three days but the grail spacecrafts took much longer namely months because they covered more than million miles reshaping and merging their orbits so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon nasa said. the orbiters whose mission was timed to miss lunar eclipses in december and june are expected to collect data for days. maria zuber principal investigator for grail said the moon remains mysterious in many ways and little is known about the process of how it was formed scientists theorize that the moon formed when a marssized object crashed into earth. it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side the basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side and the other side has mountainous highlands why did these sides evolve differently. we think the answer is locked in the interior zuber said at a nasa news briefing wednesday. a study published in the journal nature over the summer suggested that there may have been a second moon moving at about the same speed as our moon and in the same orbit. the second moon bumped into the original moon the theory goes and caused the formation of a mountain instead of a crater this model predicts the whole exterior of the moon was once molten and cooled from the outside in such a way that when the second moon hit our moon it pushed all of that molten material to the near side. grail can help test this hypothesis the spacecraft are designed to help scientists explore the interior of the moon indirectly by measuring the pull of gravity as they fly over the surface with data about these changes in gravity and topography scientists will be able to construct a map of whats inside our celestial neighbor. scientists wanted the spacecraft to be as small as possible so they could launch in one rocket. but they werent sure if the orbiters would make it through eclipses that happen at the moon every six months since their technology depends on lithiumion batteries and solar panels. a lunar eclipse occurred in early december and the next one is in june based on the current performance scientists think grail can continue through the june eclipse. should one of the orbiters completely fail scientists could not get the high precision they would get from the two spacecraft the mission depends on having both zuber said if the lunar orbit insertion doesnt happen for one of the spacecraft there would be another opportunity to try again in late april. \n",

      " - among the calls for justice in the maryville missouri rape case is one from a familiar guy fawkes maskwearing face. anonymous the activist hacking collective that has instigated cyberattacks on such groups as the church of scientology and the westboro baptist church made a statement tuesday regarding the case of daisy coleman the high schooler who says she was raped by a local football player the case is back in the news after a recent investigative report by the kansas city star raised questions about the way it was handled. we demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of daisys case anonymous said we have heard daisys story far too often we heard it from steubenville halifax and uttar pradesh if maryville wont defend these young girls if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs if justice system has abandoned them then we will have to stand for them. the statement closed with anonymous traditional tagline we are anonymous we are legion we do not forgive we do not forget. missouri prosecutor to seek special prosecutor in teen rape case. a rape case may seem like a strange cause for anonymous which is better known for defending internet freedoms but its not the first time the group has gotten involved in highprofile episodes of of bullying or sexual assault. last year it posted information about the reputed tormenter of amanda todd the vancouver girl who committed suicide in after a topless photo of her led to teasing and abuse at school. anonymous also threatened to reveal names of students involved in the steubenville ohio rape case involving a high school girl who was sexually assaulted by two high school football players witnesses to the crime talked about the incident on social media sites sharing photographs and using degrading terms for the victim. cnn reached out to anonymous for comment via a twitter site affiliated with the collective but did not immediately receive a reply. the group sees itself as a defender of the defenseless it was also active in spreading the word of the occupy movement and making trouble for opponents. who is anonymous everyone and no one. anonymous likens itself to the air force of the occupy movement cnns amber lyon reported in when they see evidence of what they believe is police misbehavior anonymous strikes back releasing personal information about specific officers. gabriella coleman a professor at mcgill university in montreal whos written extensively on anonymous says the group has gotten involved with rape cases only recently. historically anonymous tended to get involved in censorship and social movements she said but because they have no mandates there have been operations relating to any and every cause if theres one that becomes particularly powerful and i would say thats what happened with steubenville then it does become part of the repertoire of injustices they get involved in. if theres a particular perceived injustice the group is more driven to get involved coleman says in the maryville case authorities dropped the charges against the athletes who had been implicated in the alleged rape. but coleman adds theres also a bit of chance involved she said anonymous picked up on the maryville case after a twitter message was sent to an account affiliated with the group it read this is what happens when anonymous doesnt get involved in a rape case with a link to the kansas city star story. the fact that the case was essentially closed may have prodded the collective she adds. basically its case closed she said if it was an ongoing case they would still maybe get involved but it attracts more attention in a situation like this there are still a lot of questions. maryville is the third rape case anonymous has been part of in a year she observes. though anonymous originated out of the website and initially took on activities for thrills its focus has changed in the past few years says coleman now operations tend to be politically motivated and theres even some backbiting if things get out of hand. for example people involved in the maryville project have been critical of the steubenville operation because there was so much collateral damage coleman said. they do learn from previous operations she said though the nature of anonymous is that its activities remain fluid. its difficult to know whether anonymous demands have had any impact on the maryville case but missouri lt gov peter kinder on tuesday called for a grand jury review of the evidence. \n",

      " - security forces in iran on thursday confronted thousands of protesting iranians across the city first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building witnesses and news reports said. mourners gather around the grave of neda aghsoltan in beheshte zahra cemetery. clashes erupted at the cemetery as two of irans main opposition leaders tried to join the several thousand people at a memorial for the slain woman who became the symbol of irans postelection violence witnesses said. the gathering was banned but participants ignored the government strictures. however security forces barred opposition leaders mir hossein moussavi and mehdi karrubi from the gravesite of neda aghasoltan the woman shot in election protests on june witnesses and news reports said. more than people were gathered at aghasoltans grave a witness said. mourners arrived on the religiously significant day after the fatal shooting in tehran for iranians a predominantly shiite muslim population the day after a death marks the last official day of mourning. at the cemetery security forces used tear gas to clear the area of demonstrators and mourners a witness said riot police and basij militia were at the scene but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia watch a report on the memorial clashes. the witness spotted instances of the batonwielding militia charging the gathering and said as many as nine beatings were seen other people appeared to have been beaten as they ran from police the witness said one of the mourners had a bloody head and one woman said she was struck on the back of the neck. one security force member sustained some sort of injury to the head and was bloodied it is unclear exactly how that person was injured. a confrontation between women protesters and police also was seen the women shouted dont beat up our young people you our muslim brothers it is a shame to beat up our young people. the crowd chanted ya hossein mir hossein the first a reference to the revered shiite imam and the second a reference to moussavi then there were more chants of allah wa akbar or god is great ireportcom share your photos video stories. despite reports of arrests none were seen on the mourning day. us state department spokesman ian kelly said using force to break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in islam the mourning after days was particularly disturbing. we stand by the iranian people who are exercising their universal right to selfexpression and demonstrating peacefully kelly said. irans staterun news agency irna reported that the mourners disrupted the order in the city and damaged public and private property and that security forces were merely trying to control the illegal activity of the group. irna also reported that tehran residents in the area were angry with the constant protests and wanted a stronger response from the security forces. another witness told cnn that police directing traffic at the cemetery were helpful and friendly in stark contrast to the riot police and revolutionary guard members who were at the gravesites. from the cemetery the mourners arrived at the mossalla a building under construction that is expected to be the main venue of tehrans friday prayers witnesses said a couple thousand people demonstrated and police worked to disperse the crowd which also was defying a ban on such a gathering. the police tried to discourage drivers from driving the main highway that would lead to central tehran but very few listened one witness said soldiers standing along the streets flashed the peace sign back at the honking cars with large smiles on their faces it was obvious the soldiers and police forces were with the people. thousands also marched and chanted along a prominent thoroughfare called vali asr street chanting slogans such as death to the dictator amid the honking of car horns a witness said amateur video posted thursday on several web sites and submitted to cnns ireport showed a security officer swinging a baton at a demonstrator cnn cannot confirm the circumstances of the images. protesters gathered near the interior ministry building and trash cans were set ablaze another witness said police on motorcycles attempted to break up the gathering and one security officer was seen wielding a gun. moussavi was the chief challenger of incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad in the june presidential elections which the government said ahmadinejad won in a landslide but many iranians think was rigged. moussavi had said on his web site that he and fellow reform candidate karrubi would commemorate aghasoltans death with her mother at the beheshtezahra cemetery. at the cemetery a witness said a car identical to a vehicle belonging to moussavi drove through the area it was not clear if moussavi was in the vehicle but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it the car left the scene. in the days after the june vote thousands of iranians took to the streets to protest the results. the government cracked down hundreds were detained in prison among them political figures accused of playing key roles in the street demonstrations that turned violent iranian media reported wednesday. among those still reportedly detained is shahpour kazemi moussavis brotherinlaw according to moussavis wife. others include behzad nabavi a moussavi ally and mostafa tajzadeh who served under iranian president mohammad khatami a moussavi supporter the iranian labor news agency reported tuesday. \n",

       "'inter milan coach jose mourinho will lead his italian team into their first european champions league final in years on may. his task will be to drive inter milan to their first european cup title since by defeating german champions bayern munich at the bernabeu stadium in madrid this saturday. like bayern coach van gaal the is targeting a treble having already secured the italian league and cup titles this year. a victory for the italians would also signal a second treble for mourinho who last achieved the three required victories at porto back in. can mourinho beat van gaal to become king of europe. inters run to the final of the european competition was made all the more impressive with a win over title holders barcelona in the semifinal. record. after promising but brief spells coaching at portuguese sides benfica and uniao de leira mourinho brought home his first silverware while in charge at porto where he claimed the league and cup titles in his first year and treble in the second. mourinho then moved on to english premier league side chelsea where he won six trophies in his three years at the helm including the league titles in and and the fa cup and league cup in. since mourinho has been at inter milan where he won the serie a title in his first year as coach successfully defending the title in as well as winning the domestic cup. if the team go on to win the champions league final it will be the first time the milan side has done so since they beat benfica in the final in. perhaps the most impressive stat to mourinhos name is his run of unbeaten home matches across his reigns at inter milan chelsea and porto his last league defeat on home turf coming at porto in. personality. dont call me arrogant but im european champion and i think im a special one were the first words spoken by mourinho upon his arrival at chelsea in and he has since been dubbed the special one by the english press. mourinho has never failed to provide the media with entertaining press conferences and many memorable quotes though such outspoken comments have caused trouble down the years as well as making mourinho a big personality. however his ambition on the football field cannot be underestimated and there is speculation that mourinho might leave inter for real madrid after the final. he has been quoted in the past as saying he has dreams of coaching in england italy and spain so it would not be a surprise if his next challenge was at the bernabeu. previous clashes. mourinho learnt his trade working as assistants at estrela amadora porto and barcelona. at the spanish club he was first a translator for english manager bobby robson and then second in command to louis van gaal who he says he learnt a lot from in the early stages of his career. van gaal is a very confident person and at a moment when a coach like me was young that was very important he gave me the confidence to coach the team on the pitch mourinho said. the rivalry between the pair intensified when mourinho became the first coach in history to guide three different teams to the semifinals of the champions league only for van gaal to do the same a day later. and whoever finishes on top on saturday will join an even more elite group of those to have coached more than one team to the final of the competition. austrian ernst happel and german ottmar hitzfeld are the only two coaches to have done so in the past whether or not he can do it this weekend mourinho is confident that he will at some point in his career. i will do it one day but i would love to do it now because of the circumstances of inter not winning the competition for a long time. tactics. mourinho has been praised for his teams resilience in the second leg of the champions league semifinal against barcelona when despite being reduced to men they still managed to keep the spanish challenge at bay and go through on aggregate. the inter coach is reported to be a big fan of long fitness sessions and punishing long training runs to keep his squad in shape a technique also used by van gaal and it is this which is thought to have helped get mourinhos side through to the final. he will be hoping that this will also stand them in good stead in the final against bayern munich especially as like the german team who are without franck ribery they will be missing a key player through suspension midfielder thiago motta. mourinho will be looking to veteran captain javier zanetti dutch playmaker wesley sneijder and cameroonian striker samuel etoo who has won two champions league titles with barcelona in and to take him to victory in the competition that he has described as even bigger than the world cup.
